# B1-B1-Visa

The data analysis aims to first melt cleaned B1 and B2 visa excel files and then isolate china with some of the major countries such as Japan, India, South Koera and then export it into shorter csv file that is better for Tabelu visualization. 

I also wish to do the same thing with the H1b data by first cleaning it by taking out gender and other informatiosn that are not useful, and then melt them by countries and years, isolate only China, Japan, India, and South Koera, and finally exporting them as a cleaner CSV file for visualization on Tableu.
